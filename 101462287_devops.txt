COMP 3104 Dev Ops Course

The COMP 3104 course in the T197 program teaches students about Development Operations, which combines software development and information technology operations. 

This course builds on the agile software development philosophy. Common activities of DevOps engineers include handling requests from both internal and external clients, ensuring that the systems are working securely and properly. Another responsibility is the build pipelines, an event which helps a DevOps engineer determine the impact of a code change. 

In short, DevOps engineers ensure that the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) runs smoothly. To ensure success, they must ensure a line of connection between the clients and the primary developers.

There are plenty of opportunities in the market for DevOps. Personally, two of my friends are currently in positions as DevOps engineers.

The DevOps course covers GitHub, Travis-Ci, Docker, Kubernetes and Sonarqube. 
Github is a website where code can be stored remotely, allowing for seamless collaboration.
Travis-CI is a tool which builds pipelines. These are automated workflow processes that are reusable and easy to use.
Docker will help students familiarize themselves with packages.
Kubernetes allows students to work with containerized applications.
Finally, analyzes code to ensure code quality and assist in debugging.
