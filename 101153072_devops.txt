The **COMP 3104 DevOps** course at **George Brown College** focuses on the principles and practices of DevOps, which combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to improve collaboration, efficiency, and automation in the development lifecycle. Here's an outline of what to expect from the course:

### **Course Overview**
COMP 3104 is designed to introduce students to the concepts of DevOps, emphasizing automation, continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD), and collaboration between development and operations teams. It typically covers the following areas:

- **DevOps Principles**: Understanding the goals of DevOps, including faster delivery, higher-quality software, and reducing the gap between development and operations.
  
- **Version Control with Git**: Students learn to use Git for source code management, including branching, merging, and collaborating with team members.

- **CI/CD Pipelines**: The course introduces continuous integration and continuous delivery pipelines. Students learn how to automate testing and deployment to streamline the software release process.

- **Containerization with Docker**: An important part of DevOps, Docker is covered to teach students how to package applications in containers, making them easier to deploy in different environments.

- **Automation Tools**: Students work with automation tools like Jenkins, which helps automate parts of the development lifecycle, especially testing and deployment.

- **Configuration Management**: Introduction to configuration management tools like Ansible or Puppet, which help manage infrastructure as code (IaC).

- **Cloud Platforms**: The course may also touch on cloud-based DevOps, such as deploying applications on platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.

- **Monitoring and Logging**: Understanding the importance of monitoring systems and logging in production environments to detect and resolve issues early.


### **Learning Outcomes**
By the end of the course, students will:
- Understand the key concepts of DevOps and how to apply them.
- Be able to automate the development process using CI/CD tools.
- Gain practical experience in containerization and deploying applications using Docker.
- Be familiar with cloud platforms and their role in DevOps.
